    # ===== Problem 2a =====
    # Define Matrix M and Vectors a,b,c in Python with NumPy

    M, a, b, c = None, None, None, None

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE
    M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [0, 2, 2]])
    a = np.array([1, 1, 0])
    b = np.array([-1, 2, 5])
    c = np.array([0, 2, 3, 2])
    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2b =====
    # Find the dot product of vectors a and b, save the value to aDotb

    aDotb = None

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE
    aDotb = a.T.dot(b)
    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2c =====
    # Find the element-wise product of a and b

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE
    aMulb = a * b
    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2d =====
    # Find (a^T b)Ma

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE
    resD = aDotb*M.dot(a)
    print('(a^T b)Ma: \n', resD)
    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2e =====
    # Without using a loop, multiply each row of M element-wise by a.
    # Hint: The function repmat() may come in handy.

    newM = None
    
    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE
    newa = np.matlib.repmat(a, 4, 1)
    newM = newa * M
    print('multiply each row of M element-wise by a: \n', newM)
    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2f =====
    # Without using a loop, sort all of the values 
    # of M in increasing order and plot them.
    # Note we want you to use newM from e.

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE
    sortedM = np.sort(newM, axis=None)
    print('sorted M: \n', sortedM)

    x = np.linspace(1, 12, 12)
    plt.scatter(x, sortedM)
    plt.show()
    # END YOUR CODE HERE
